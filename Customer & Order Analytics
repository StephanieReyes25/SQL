#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT count (orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where length (orderID) =6
AND orderID <> 'order Id';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count (orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where product = 'iPhone' 
AND length (orderID) =6
AND orderID <> 'order Id';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIt_DB.customers customers
Inner JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales sales
ON customers.order_id=sales.orderID
WHERE length (orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order Id'; 

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT MIN (price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT sum (quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

Select 
sum(Quantity), product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group By product,price;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT Count (distinct cust.acctnum), avg (quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FEBSales Feb
Left Join BIT_DB. customers cust
On cust.order_ID=FEB.orderID
WHERE Feb.quantity >2
AND length (orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
